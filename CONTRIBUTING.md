# Contributing to KoalaBot
Thank you for taking time to contribute, any change at all continues to make Koala better!\
If you are here just to ask a question head over to our support [Discord server](https://discord.koalabot.uk) where our developers can help you out!

## 1. Feature Request/ Bug Report
What is it that you want to be added or changed?
Please create an issue on the KoalaBot GitHub page using the provided issue templates, giving **detailed** information about your request.

Create an issue [here](https://github.com/KoalaBotUK/KoalaBot/issues/new/choose)

## 2. Getting Started with Implementation
### Fork the Repo (Public Contributor)
Fork the [KoalaBot GitHub repository](https://github.com/KoalaBotUK/KoalaBot), it is fine to leave the name as KoalaBot.

You will then need to clone the repo you've created locally to make your edits. Before you begin your changes, make sure you can both run the bot and the tests, instructions for which are [here](https://github.com/KoalaBotUK/KoalaBot/blob/master/README.md)

### Make a Branch (KoalaBot Dev Team)
Make a branch with a descriptive name with lowercase words separated with `-` (e.g. `react-for-role` or `fix-verify-email-formatting`)

You will then need to clone the repo you've created locally to make your edits. Before you begin your changes, make sure you can both run the bot and the tests, instructions for which are [here](https://github.com/KoalaBotUK/KoalaBot/blob/master/README.md)

## 3. Make your changes
While you make edits, use frequent commits to describe progression, do **not** commit once when complete or when massive changes have been made as this makes it hard to debug.

Things to ensure you do during implementation:
* Include documentation of each method and class within your code through RestructuredText docstrings
* Add tests for any created methods using pytest and dpytest (or explain in the pull request why a test is missing)
* If any new bot commands are added, modify `documentation.json`
* Look out for and fix common security issues (e.g. sql injection)
* 

## 4. Create a Draft Pull Request (optional)
If you are ever confused while developing, refer to other examples or message us on our support discord. 
However, if your question is specific to parts of your code it is a good idea to instead make a pull request (below) and mark as draft. This allows us to answer questions during development and reference your code.
